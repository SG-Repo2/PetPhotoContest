Now, while our 5-year-old Remi dog may be the cutest thing you've ever seen what you don't know is that he's a pint-sized assassin. He is obsessed with squeaky toys. To him, it‚Äôs not just a toy; it‚Äôs a nemesis, taunting him with every high-pitched squeak. He‚Äôs not playing; he‚Äôs hunting. The moment he gets his paws on it, it‚Äôs game over‚Äîteeth gnashing, stuffing flying, a scene straight out of a canine crime drama. He‚Äôs not satisfied until he‚Äôs ripped out that squeaky heart and silenced it forever, leaving a trail of plush carnage behind. However, let a balloon enter the room with our fearless squeaky-slaying dachshund those floppy ears go flat, his stubby legs tremble, and he‚Äôs in your lap faster than you can say helium.\n\nWhile an average dachshund is between 20-27 inches from nose tip to the base of their tail, Remi is a whopping 31 inches long!",
